# Analyzing Data From a Food Ordering and Delivery Application

 In this project we used data from a food ordering and delivery application to analyze customer satisfaction ratings and make food recommendations 
 
 ## The Dataset
 
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants. 
 
We are using the dataset from Foodhub, a food delivery app centered in New York City. The dataset includes unique order IDs, customer order IDs, restaurant names, cuisine types, cost of the order, day of the week, customer rating, food preparation time, and food delivery time. The dataset can be found inside the dataset folder of this project or in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset)
